## Branches

- Genetic engineering: modifying organisms by changing their DNA
- Molecular biology: analysis of organisms at the molecular level
- Synthetic biology: engineering biological components
- Genetics: studying genes and how they affect populations

## Genetics

### Basic gene structure (top down)

- Promoter: place where protein binds to RNA to start transcription
- Kozac/RBS: where the ribosome binds to the RNA
- Start codon: the codon that indicates the start of the protein sequence
- Coding sequence: the RNA that codes the protein sequence
- Stop codon: the codon that indicates the end of the protein sequence
- Terminator: where the ribosome releases the RNA
